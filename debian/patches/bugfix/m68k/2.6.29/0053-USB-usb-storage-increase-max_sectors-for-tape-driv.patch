Subject: [PATCH 53/90] USB: usb-storage: increase max_sectors for tape drives

upstream commit: 5c16034d73da2c1b663aa25dedadbc533b3d811c

This patch (as1203) increases the max_sector limit for USB tape
drives.  By default usb-storage sets max_sectors to 240 (i.e., 120 KB)
for all devices.  But tape drives need a higher limit, since tapes can
and do have very large block sizes.  Without the ability to transfer
an entire large block in a single command, such tapes can't be used.

This fixes Bugzilla #12207.
