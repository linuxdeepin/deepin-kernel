Subject: [PATCH 86/90] sparc64: Fix MM refcount check in smp_flush_tlb_pending().

[ Upstream commit f9384d41c02408dd404aa64d66d0ef38adcf6479 ]

As explained by Benjamin Herrenschmidt:

> CPU 0 is running the context, task->mm == task->active_mm == your
> context. The CPU is in userspace happily churning things.
>
> CPU 1 used to run it, not anymore, it's now running fancyfsd which

To fix this problem, check ->mm instead of ->active_mm, and this
means:

> So if you test current->mm, you effectively account for mm_users == 1,
> so the only way the mm can be active on another processor is as a lazy
> mm for a kernel thread. So your test should work properly as long
> as you don't have a HW that will do speculative TLB reloads into the
> TLB on that other CPU (and even if you do, you flush-on-switch-in should
> get rid of any crap here).

And therefore we should be OK.
