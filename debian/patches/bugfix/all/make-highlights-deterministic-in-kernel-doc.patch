Subject: parse kernel-doc deterministically

Regular expressions for highlights in kernel-doc are stored in a Perl
hash. These hashes are ordered differently for each Perl run. This will
prevent kernel-doc to behave deterministically when parsing
“@foo()” as in some runs it will be interpreted as a parameter and
in the others it will be interpreted as a function.

We now sort the %highlights hash to get the same behavior on every run.
