Subject: [PATCH] fs/exec.c: fix initial stack reservation

803bf5ec259941936262d10ecc84511b76a20921 ("fs/exec.c: restrict initial
stack space expansion to rlimit") attempts to limit the initial stack to
20*PAGE_SIZE.  Unfortunately, in attempting ensure the stack is not
reduced in size, we ended up not changing the stack at all.

This size reduction check is not necessary as the expand_stack call does
this already.

This caused a regression in UML resulting in most guest processes being
killed.
