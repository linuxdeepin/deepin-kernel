Subject: selftests: vm: Try harder to allocate huge pages
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/ee00479d6702393bf5eda94775349a2e28ba78fa

If we need to increase the number of huge pages, drop caches first
to reduce fragmentation and then check that we actually allocated
as many as we wanted.  Retry once if that doesn't work.
