Subject: perf: Hide ABI change in 3.2.30
Forwarded: not-needed

<linux/perf_events.h> is included by many source files but we don't
want to bump the ABI number again right now.

The new member (atomic_long_t refcount) has the same size as the old
(struct file *filp) and neither should be needed by OOT modules (if
they make use of perf_events at all).  So pretend this didn't happen.
