Subject: fjes: Disable auto-loading
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/853976
Forwarded: no

fjes matches a generic ACPI device ID, and relies on its probe
function to distinguish whether that really corresponds to a supported
device.  Very few system will need the driver and it wastes memory on
all the other systems where the same device ID appears, so disable
auto-loading.
