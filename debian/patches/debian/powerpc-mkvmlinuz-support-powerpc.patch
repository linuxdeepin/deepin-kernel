# Mkvmlinuz support patch, called by debian's kernel-package to generate
# the files needed by mkvmlinuz to generate the bootable images from vmlinux.
# Author: Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>
# Based on work from: Jens Schmalzing <jensen@debian.org>
# Original comment from Jens :
#   This shell script is intended to be put into the debian subdirectory
#   of a Linux kernel tree, where make-kpkg will find and execute it
#   while building a kernel-image package.  The purpose of this script
#   is to add glue (object code, libraries, utilities and so on) from
#   the kernel tree to the kernel-image package.  Later, the mkvmlinuz
#   utility, which is available as a separate Debian package, can use
#   this glue to create a bootable compressed kernel from the
#   uncompressed kernel in the kernel-image package and optionally a
#   ramdisk.  This is especially important on PowerPC subarchitectures
#   that don't have a boot loader, but also comes handy for rescue
#   systems and the like.
# Upstream status: This patch stays a debian specific patch for now,
# but it is not in a form where it could go upstream.
