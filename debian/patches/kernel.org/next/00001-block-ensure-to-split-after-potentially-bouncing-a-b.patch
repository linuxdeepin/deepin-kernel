Subject: block: ensure to split after potentially bouncing a bio
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/23688bf4f830a89866fd0ed3501e342a7360fe4f
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/809082

blk_queue_bio() does split then bounce, which makes the segment
counting based on pages before bouncing and could go wrong. Move
the split to after bouncing, like we do for blk-mq, and the we
fix the issue of having the bio count for segments be wrong.

Fixes: 54efd50bfd87 ("block: make generic_make_request handle arbitrarily sized bios")
