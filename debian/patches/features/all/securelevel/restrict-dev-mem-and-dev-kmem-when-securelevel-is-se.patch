Subject: [05/18] Restrict /dev/mem and /dev/kmem when securelevel is set.
Origin: https://github.com/mjg59/linux/commit/401996625d478c814fe9e736ca9e6c5c5f055f06

Allowing users to write to address space provides mechanisms that may permit
modification of the kernel at runtime. Prevent this if securelevel has been
set.
