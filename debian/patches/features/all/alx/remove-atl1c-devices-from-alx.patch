Subject: alx: remove atl1c devices
Date: Sun, 27 Jan 2013 23:37:52 +0000
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/699129
Forwarded: not-needed

When alx was first reviewed, upstream demanded that any changes to
support for the currently supported AR8131/8132/8151/8152 chips be
made as a series of patches, not by deprecating or removing atl1c in a
monolithic patch.  Therefore:

I've also changed the Kconfig help text to reflect this.
