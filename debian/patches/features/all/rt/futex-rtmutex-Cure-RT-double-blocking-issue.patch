Subject: [PATCH] futex/rtmutex: Cure RT double blocking issue
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.11/older/patches-4.11.5-rt1.tar.xz

RT has a problem when the wait on a futex/rtmutex got interrupted by a
timeout or a signal. task->pi_blocked_on is still set when returning from
rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock(). The task must acquire the hash bucket lock
after this.

If the hash bucket lock is contended then the
BUG_ON(rt_mutex_real_waiter(task->pi_blocked_on)) in
task_blocks_on_rt_mutex() will trigger.

This can be avoided by clearing task->pi_blocked_on in the return path of
rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock() which removes the task from the boosting chain
of the rtmutex. That's correct because the task is not longer blocked on
it.
