Subject: [PATCH] lockref: disable 64bit cmpxchg optimization on RT
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/3.12/patches-3.12.5-rt7.tar.xz

One of the requirements is that the lock has to fit in an u32 which does
not work with the sleeping locks. We would have to use the bare raw
locks for this and I would like to avoid this.
