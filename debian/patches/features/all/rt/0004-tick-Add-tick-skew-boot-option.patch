Subject: [004/256] tick: Add tick skew boot option

Let the user decide whether power consumption or jitter is the
more important consideration for their machines.

Quoting removal commit af5ab277ded04bd9bc6b048c5a2f0e7d70ef0867:

"Historically, Linux has tried to make the regular timer tick on the
 various CPUs not happen at the same time, to avoid contention on
 xtime_lock.

 Nowadays, with the tickless kernel, this contention no longer happens
 since time keeping and updating are done differently. In addition,
 this skew is actually hurting power consumption in a measurable way on
 many-core systems."

Problems:

    - Contrary to the above, systems do encounter contention on both
      xtime_lock and RCU structure locks when the tick is synchronized.

    - Moderate sized RT systems suffer intolerable jitter due to the tick
      being synchronized.

    - SGI reports the same for their large systems.

    - Fully utilized systems reap no power saving benefit from skew removal,
      but do suffer from resulting induced lock contention.

    - 0209f649 rcu: limit rcu_node leaf-level fanout
      This patch was born to combat lock contention which testing showed
      to have been _induced by_ skew removal.  Skew the tick, contention
      disappeared virtually completely.
