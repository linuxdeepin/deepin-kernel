Subject: [PATCH] seqlock: consolidate spin_lock/unlock waiting with
 spin_unlock_wait
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/3.12/patches-3.12.5-rt7.tar.xz

since c2f21ce ("locking: Implement new raw_spinlock")
include/linux/spinlock.h includes spin_unlock_wait() to wait for a concurren
holder of a lock. this patch just moves over to that API. spin_unlock_wait
covers both raw_spinlock_t and spinlock_t so it should be safe here as well.
the added rt-variant of read_seqbegin in include/linux/seqlock.h that is being
modified, was introduced by patch:
  seqlock-prevent-rt-starvation.patch

behavior should be unchanged.
