Subject: [PATCH] futex: Change locking rules
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.11/older/patches-4.11.5-rt1.tar.xz

Upstream commit 734009e96d1983ad739e5b656e03430b3660c913

Currently futex-pi relies on hb->lock to serialize everything. But hb->lock
creates another set of problems, especially priority inversions on RT where
hb->lock becomes a rt_mutex itself.

The rt_mutex::wait_lock is the most obvious protection for keeping the
futex user space value and the kernel internal pi_state in sync.

Rework and document the locking so rt_mutex::wait_lock is held accross all
operations which modify the user space value and the pi state.

This allows to invoke rt_mutex_unlock() (including deboost) without holding
hb->lock as a next step.

Nothing yet relies on the new locking rules.
