This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Linux kernel.
Linux was written by Linus Torvalds <Linus.Torvalds@cs.Helsinki.FI>
and others.

This package was put together by Simon Shapiro <Shimon@i-Connect.Net>, from
sources retrieved from directories under
ftp.cs.helsinki.fi:/pub/Software/Linux/Kernel/
The sources may be found at most Linux ftp sites, including 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/

This package was then maintained by Sven Rudolph and subsequently
David Huggins-Daines.

This package has been maintained by Herbert Xu <herbert@debian.org>
since March 1997.

Now, it is maintained by Joshua Kwan <joshk@triplehelix.org>.
