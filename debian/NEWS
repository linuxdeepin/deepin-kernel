linux-2.6 (2.6.32-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * The old IDE (PATA) drivers are no longer developed, but most PATA
    controllers can be handled by new drivers using 'libata', which is
    already used for SATA controllers.  This release enables all the new
    drivers that are considered stable and disables the old drivers that
    they replace.

    While the old drivers presented device names beginning with 'hd',
    libata makes PATA drives appear as SCSI devices and presents device
    names beginning with 'sd' (hard drive), 'sr' (optical) or 'st' (tape).
    In a system that already has other SCSI or SCSI-like devices, names
    may change unpredictably.

    During the upgrade from earlier versions, you will be prompted to
    update configuration files which refer to device names that may
    change.  You can choose to do this yourself or to follow an automatic
    upgrade process.  Unfortunately the automatic upgrade process does not
    cover tape drives.  All changed configuration files are backed up with
    a suffix of '.old' (or '^old' in one case).
