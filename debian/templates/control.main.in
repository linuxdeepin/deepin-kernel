Description: Linux kernel source for version @version@ with Debian patches
 This package provides source code for the Linux kernel version @version@.
 This source closely tracks official Linux kernel releases.  Debian's
 modifications to that source consist of security fixes, bug fixes, and
 features that have already been (or we believe will be) accepted by the
 upstream maintainers.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.
