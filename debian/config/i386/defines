part-long-pae: This kernel requires PAE (Physical Address Extension).
 This feature is supported by the Intel Pentium Pro/II/III/4/4M/D, Xeon,
 Core and Atom; AMD Geode NX, Athlon (K7), Duron, Opteron, Sempron,
 Turion or Phenom; Transmeta Efficeon; VIA C7; and some other processors.

 which is supported by Pentium-compatible processors and the
 DM&P/SiS Vortex86.
